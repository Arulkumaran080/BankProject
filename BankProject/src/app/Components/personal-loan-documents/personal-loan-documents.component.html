    <h2>Documents Required For Personal Loans</h2>
    <p>Your Bank makes your loan process seamless with the minimal documents required for a Personal Loan. Our Personal Loan documentation includes an ID proof, an address proof, and a bank statement or a salary slip. For self-employed applicants, the documents required may differ. Be sure to check the documents needed before applying for Personal Loan.</p>
    <p>Your Bank also offers pre-approved loans to its select clients. For pre-approved loans no documentation is required, and once an application is made, the loan is instantly disbursed in the applicantâ€™s account.</p>
